# Ansible Development Environment
Examples of preparing an Ansible Development Environment to support onboarding automation across multiple teams

## Ansible Remote Server

## Visual Studio Code
Using VSCode with the following extensions:

- Ansible
- Remote Development

## Linting
Adding linting capabilities can be as simple as leveraging the `ansible` extension in VSCode which uses the `ansible-lint` tool to performing basic linting of your Ansible content. However it does require the installation of `ansible-lint` where it can be called by the `ansible` extension.
